# Scientific Machine Learning Workshop

This repository contains all presentation slides, lab handouts, and lab code for the Scientific Machine Learning workshop at Cenpes, August 11-August 15. 

The workshop offers an opportunity for attendees to improve their analytical and computational skills in the rapidly-developing field of scientific machine learning, while preparing them to work in highly interdisciplinary research and development projects. The workshop is structured as follows:

## Day 1
### Morning: 
- Introduction and overview
- Basics of Machine Learning, focusing on regression techniques

### Afternoon:
- Lab 1: Polynomial regression; Running a trained Navier-Stokes PINN

## Day 2
Morning:
- Deep Neural Network training
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)

Afternoon:
- Lab 2: Training a PINN to solving forward and inverse problems

## Day 3
### Morning:
- Gaussian Process regression
- Bayesian PDE solvers

### Afternoon:
- Lab 3: Solving forward and inverse problems with Gaussian Processes
