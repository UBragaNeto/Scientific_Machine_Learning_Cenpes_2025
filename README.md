# Scientific Machine Learning Workshop

This repository will contain all presentation slides, lab handouts, and lab code for the Scientific Machine Learning workshop at Cenpes. 

The workshop offers an opportunity for attendees to improve their analytical and computational skills in the rapidly-developing field of scientific machine learning, while preparing them to work in highly interdisciplinary research and development projects. The workshop is structured as follows:

## Day 1
### Morning: 
- Introduction and overview
- Basics of Machine Learning, focusing on regression techniques

### Afternoon:
- Lab 1: Polynomial regression; Running a trained Navier-Stokes PINN

## Day 2
Morning:
- Deep Neural Network training
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)

Afternoon:
- Lab 2: Training a PINN to solving forward and inverse problems

## Day 3
### Morning:
- Gaussian Process regression
- Bayesian PDE solvers

### Afternoon:
- Lab 3: Solving forward and inverse problems with Gaussian Processes

## Day 4
### Morning:
- Introduction to Model Order Reduction 
- Physics-based MOR: Linear and Nonlinear Model Reduction
- Data-driven MOR Part 1: System Identification, SINDy, DMD 

### Afternoon:
- Lab 4a: Tutorial on Balanced Truncation, Krylov Subspaces, POD, POD-DEIM
- Lab 4b: POD-DEIM for reservoir simulation

## Day 5
### Morning:
- Data-driven MOR Part 2: DMDc, OpInf, E2C0, FNO

### Afternoon:
